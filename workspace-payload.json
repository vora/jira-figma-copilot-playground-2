  "summary": "Implement Confirmation Modal Component",
  "description": "Create a reusable confirmation modal component that aligns with the new design system. The modal will be used across the application for actions such as deleting items, publishing content, and confirming navigation.

The modal must follow the layout, spacing, typography, and interaction states defined in the Figma design.

*Figma Reference*
[https://www.figma.com/file/ABC123/mock-confirmation-modal|https://www.figma.com/file/ABC123/mock-confirmation-modal]

*Requirements*

# Modal opens when triggered by a parent component via state.
# Supports a title, message body, and configurable primary/secondary buttons.
# Modal must trap focus until closed.
# Should close when clicking the “Cancel” button, pressing ESC, or clicking the background overlay.
# Should be accessible (ARIA labels, roles, keyboard navigation).
# Should be implemented with the existing UI primitives.
# Include simple enter/exit animations.

*Acceptance Criteria*

* User triggers an action and the modal appears overlaying the page.
* Modal displays title and message from passed props.
* Buttons trigger callback functions provided by the parent.
* Focus is correctly trapped inside the modal until it closes.
* ESC key closes the modal.
* Modal matches Figma design at the link above.
* All unit tests pass.

*Technical Notes*

* Use existing dialog component if available; otherwise create base layer.
* Ensure responsive behavior on mobile.
* Add Storybook entry for the component.",
